# Land of Lisp


- To define a global variable, use the defparameter command.
- To define a global function, use the defun command.
- Use the let and flet commands to define local variables and functions, respectively.
- The function labels is like flet, but it lets functions call themselves. Functions that call themselves are called recursive functions.
